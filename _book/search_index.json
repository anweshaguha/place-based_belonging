The Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative is: an ongoing, multicohort, longitudinal research program designed to holistically understand institutional inputs to undergraduate students’ wellbeing and success across the college experience an educational program designed to equitably improve wellbeing and success outcomes, particularly among historically marginalized populations (e.g., first-generation students, Black students) an assessment and evaluation program designed to gauge whether various programmatic activities, including but not limited to the ones internal to the Initiative itself, are meeting their stated goals Better understanding better informs us, affording opportunities to improve institutional practices that equitably support students’ learning and development and foster their achievement and persistence. Unlike many for-profit companies, which use data to sell people, this is a strategy that uses data to empower people. The Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative is led by Brian Clark, Assistant Director of the Office of Assessment and Research in the Division of Student Life. It is supported primarily by the Office of the Vice President for Student Life with integral support from units of the Division of Student Life – the Department of Physical Education and Recreation, the Erb Memorial Union, and the Office of the Dean of Students – and across campus from many and varied units in Global Engagement, the Office of the Provost, Student Services and Enrollment Management, UO Libraries, and Undergraduate Education and Student Success.

The purposes of this document are: to conduct a comprehensive analysis of place-based belonging data to provide a general reference and resource tool for higher education professionals who do things and make decisions about things that affect students (many of those things are tied to or rooted in physical places) to describe the development of methods used to generate place-based belonging data This document is currently under construction and is in a “good enough for now” state. It will be incrementally updated through Summer 2023, which will include adding Spring 2023 data. At that point, it will be considered complete, because we intend to augment methods dramatically the following year. Forthcoming sections include an overall summary, two content sections, and the supplemental method section. Forthcoming features include alternative text for plots and images and hover text for treemaps. 3.1 What is Place-Based Belonging? Over the last several years, we have been incrementally exploring the concept of place-based belonging: the idea that people’s affinity for physical places, or lack thereof, is intertwined with their sense of whether they fit in socially. Theoretically, it is a special case of the environmental psychology concept of place attachment (Altman &amp; Low, 1992), with conceptual focus on the place dimension over the person or process dimensions (Scannell &amp; Gifford, 2010) and content focus on social meanings with which places are imbued as a subset of the general affective associations people have with places. Methodologically, it departs significantly from the psychometric approach of much place attachment research (e.g., Williams, 2014; Williams &amp; Vaske, 2003), aligning more closely with cultural mapping. Cultural mapping is an interdisciplinary field broadly tied together by a mode of inquiry and general methodology that reckons with documenting a community’s place-based features and assets for a wide range of purposes. See Duxbury et al. (2015) for an introduction and the whole book for varied perspectives. Place-based belonging, specifically, has roots in humanistic and cultural geography traditions, which feed into cultural mapping, and is depicted by a kind of symbol mapping (Soini, 2001). Adapting methods from Pitcher &amp; Royal (2016), we ask students to click up to three places on a campus map they feel like they “belong, fit in, are connected, are accepted, etc.,” and separately, to click up to three places they feel like they “do not belong, do not fit in, are disconnected, are not accepted, etc.” After clicking “belong” and “don’t belong” places on a campus map, we follow up about select places to try and understand more about them. Generally, we ask students to describe in text why they feel the ways they do about the places. A unique aspect of follow-up involves delving into the Erb Memorial Union (EMU), which is a compact set of places, which cannot be disaggregated given a campus map and which form a unified place we call the EMU. If a student clicks on the EMU at the campus level, we follow up with a map of the EMU and ask them to click on places within the EMU they feel like they belong and don’t belong, and then ask them to describe why. (Map and follow-up methods have varied over the years of development. See Supplemental Method for more details.) The methods above generate data that allow us to do several things: describe a place and rank-order multiple places in terms of belong and don’t belong sentiments describe a place and rank-order multiple places in terms of inclusiveness, which is a combination of both belong and don’t belong sentiments disaggregate a place’s inclusiveness by demographics explore why places have belong or don’t belong sentiments associated with them describe how places relate to each other through belong and don’t belong sentiments 3.2 How to Read this Document 3.2.1 Focus You need not read or even look at all of this document at any given time. You need not understand all of it the first time you look at it. You need not remember all of it no matter how many times you look at it. You will not be tested on it. It will be available for reference when you need it. And you can ask questions about it when they occur to you. The document is generally geared toward exploring place-based belonging through visualization and description. 3.2.2 Flow There are six main sections after this one: Summary This section is forthcoming and will contain the overall take-home message. It will be the last section produced after other content sections are completed. Where? This section contains interactive tables of place-based belonging metrics, heat maps of clicks on places, and treemaps and bar plots of place inclusiveness. It is organized hierarchically by three levels: 1. population (US undergraduate, international, graduate); 2. wave (Spring 2022, Spring 2020, Spring 2019, Spring 2018); 3. year in school (4th-year, 3rd-year, 2nd-year, 1st-year). Spring 2021 is missing due to remote operations during the pandemic. Heat maps include Spring 2017 but tables, treemaps, and bar plots do not because clicks were not yet quantified. Why There? This section contains wordnets of adjacent adjective-noun pairs from, wordclouds of keywords from, and emotion classifications of students’ descriptions of why they feel they ways they do about places. It is organized hierarchically by two levels: 1. population (US undergraduate, international, graduate); 2. place (Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, and University Housing contain nested subordinate places for US undergraduates). Where for Whom? This section is forthcoming and will contain inclusiveness of popular places disaggregated by demographics. Between Here and Where? This section is forthcoming and will contain networks of places based on “belong” and “don’t belong” sentiments. Supplemental Method This section is forthcoming. It currently contains a Figure referenced in wordcloud notes and will contain detailed information about method development, procedure, and analysis. For now, methodological information is contained in notes.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank’s metrics are likely underestimated, and Lokey Science Complex appears as both an aggregated place and a subordinate place (Spring 2018) with legitimate subordinate places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 8,483; total nClickDon’tBelong = 6,186. Total nStudentBelong = 2,586; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 2,080. Again because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (n = 2,711, 86.4%), some students contributed to two waves (n = 295, 9.4%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (n = 131, 4.2%). See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “All Years” = Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “4th-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total nClickBelong = 402; total nClickDon’tBelong = 301. Total nStudentBelong = 142; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 110. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “3rd-Year” = 2019-20 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total nClickBelong = 596; total nClickDon’tBelong = 461. Total nStudentBelong = 211; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 175. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “2nd-Year” = 2020-21 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total nClickBelong = 522; total nClickDon’tBelong = 434. Total nStudentBelong = 196; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 168. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “1st-Year” = 2021-22 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total nClickBelong = 1,009; total nClickDon’tBelong = 693. Total nStudentBelong = 372; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 275.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “1st-through-5th-Year” = 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts (i.e., students who were at the end of their first, second, third, fourth, or fifth years at the UO in Spring 2018, respectively), meaning first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, or fifth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 2,866; total nClickDon’tBelong = 1,758. Total nStudentBelong = 995; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 709. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “4th-Year” = 2016-17 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 338; total nClickDon’tBelong = 259. Total nStudentBelong = 116; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 95. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “3rd-Year” = 2017-18 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 300; total nClickDon’tBelong = 175. Total nStudentBelong = 104; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 72. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “2nd-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 805; total nClickDon’tBelong = 574. Total nStudentBelong = 284; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 229. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “1st-Year” = 2019-20 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 1,400; total nClickDon’tBelong = 727. Total nStudentBelong = 483; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 304. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “1st-through-4th-Year” = 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts (i.e., students who were at the end of their first, second, third, or fourth years at the UO in Spring 2018, respectively), meaning first-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total nClickBelong = 1,814; total nClickDon’tBelong = 1,439. Total nStudentBelong = 631; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 560. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “4th-Year” = 2015-16 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total nClickBelong = 237; total nClickDon’tBelong = 207. Total nStudentBelong = 81; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 76. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “3rd-Year” = 2016-17 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total nClickBelong = 396; total nClickDon’tBelong = 324. Total nStudentBelong = 140; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 126. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “2nd-Year” = 2017-18 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total nClickBelong = 307; total nClickDon’tBelong = 253. Total nStudentBelong = 107; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 97. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. “1st-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total nClickBelong = 874; total nClickDon’tBelong = 655. Total nStudentBelong = 303; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 261. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 1,202; total nClickDon’tBelong = 1,035. Total nStudentBelong = 432; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 399. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. However, because data are limited to Spring 2020 and Spring 2022 and methods were consistent between those waves, apart from a minor mislabeling of lawn regions, inaccuracy in representing places is due to physical changes in places, with the main changes being Unthank and Knight Campus construction. Spring 2022: Degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior degree-seeking international undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 383; total nClickDon’tBelong = 223. Total nStudentBelong = 138; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 91. No one contributed data to more than one wave.

&quot;reactable&quot; Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. Degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Total nClickBelong = 126; total nClickDon’tBelong = 56. Total nStudentBelong = 48; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 24. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior degree-seeking international undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 257; total nClickDon’tBelong = 167. Total nStudentBelong = 90; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 67. See Supplemental Method for more details.

The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. Inclusive is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. n Belong and n Don’t Belong are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. Click Belong and Click Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing n Belong and n Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those ns, respectively. In other words, inclusive, n Belong, n Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all place-based metrics, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are person-based metrics. US and international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns.

Color saturation and area of blobs are dependent on concentration in a general area irrespective of regions drawn on a map, which can sometimes be inconsistent with quantification based on clicks in map regions. Additionally, the Erb Memorial Union map in Spring 2018 consisted of two vertically stacked images in presentation during data collection. This produces blob distortion across images, and it results in invalid data; although students were instructed to select up to 3 places, n = 13 selected more than 3.

Rectangle color represents a place’s inclusiveness, which is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by n Belong / (n Belong + n Don’t Belong) * 100. Yellow represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum and black represents the low end. Gray text represents inclusiveness \\(\\gt\\) 75%. “Disaggregated” = nothing was done to combine individual places into larger places (e.g., residence halls into University Housing). “Less Delimited” = the criterion for inclusion in of a place in a treemap was total click count of at least 20, which is less delimited than the criterion used in “More Delimited.” The criterion for presenting a treemap was at least 4 places represented. Additionally, all treemaps omit clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions. Some names of places with lower popularity were abbreviated to fit the text in their respective rectangles: TF = Turf Field, DS = Duck Store, Barn = Outdoor Program Barn, Cas = Cascade, FAS = Fine Art Studios, MNL = Many Nations Longhouse, MS = LERC Military Science, MNCH = Museum of Natural and Cultural History, Moss = Moss Street Children’s Center, Fent = Fenton, LLC = Living Learning Center, Essl = Esslinger, BCC = Black Cultural Center, Mac = McArthur Court, Saun Stad = Saunders Stadium, Friend = Friendly, TI = Tennis Indoor, span style = “color: #49C1AD”&gt;PLC = Prince Lucien Campbell. Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness (treemaps within academic years are accurate, and because there are fewer available data, overall treemap for international students is accurate in this respect despite combining data). For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank’s popularity is likely underestimated and its inclusiveness may be, too, and Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2018) is depicted on the treemap along with places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total nClickBelong = 8,483; total nClickDon’tBelong = 6,186. Total nStudentBelong = 2,586; total nStudentDon’tBelong = 2,080. Again because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (2,711, 86.4%), some students contributed to two waves (295, 9.4%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (131, 4.2%). See Supplemental Method for more details. Treemap was generated using the ggplot2 and treemapify packages. Colors were produced using the inferno palette of the viridis package. 5.4.1.1.2 Spring 2022 5.4.1.1.2.1 All Years Note: Rectangle size represents a place’s overall popularity, computed by n Belong + n Don’t Belong.

Yellow represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum and black represents the low end. Gray text represents inclusiveness \\(\\gt\\) 75%. The criterion for inclusion of a place in the treemap was total click count of at least 20. The criterion for presentation of a treemap was at least 4 places represented. Additionally, all treemaps omit clicks on Other and Out of Bounds regions. SSC = Student Sustainability Center, Hallway 1 = the East wing hallway on level 1 that runs in front of the Multicultural Center, Hallway 2 = the East wing hallway on level 2 that runs in front of the the Center for Student Involvement Resource Center and the Redwood Auditorium. Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness (treemaps within academic years are accurate).

Generally, US undergraduates of all years/cohorts (mostly 1st-through-4th-year and predominantly first-year) contributed data in Spring 2020 and Spring 2022. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students could have contributed data more than once, but none did. However, students did provide multiple responses for this particular analysis, because it combines responses regarding places that make up the Erb Memorial Union to form an overall representation of the Erb Memorial Union as a unified place: n = 24 students provided responses regarding one place, n = 15 provided responses regarding two places, and n = 6 provided responses regarding three places within the Erb Memorial Union. See Supplemental Method for more details. Text data were annotated using the udpipe package. Keywords were extracted using the Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm (Rose et al., 2010).

Across all places that were not subsequently aggregated into superordinate places and then disaggregated by subordinate places (i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing) as well as across sentiments (i.e., “belong” and “don’t belong”), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (1,820, 94.6%), relatively few students contributed to two waves (104, 5.4%), and no one contributed to three waves. See Supplemental Method for more details. Text data were annotated using the udpipe package. Keywords were extracted using the Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm (Rose et al., 2010). Wordcloud was generated using the wordcloud2 package.

Generally, US undergraduates of all years/cohorts (mostly 1st-through-4th-year and predominantly first-year) contributed data in Spring 2019, Spring 2020, and Spring 2022. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Across all places that were not subsequently aggregated into superordinate places and then disaggregated by subordinate places (i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing) as well as across sentiments (i.e., “belong” and “don’t belong”), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (1,820, 94.6%), relatively few students contributed to two waves (104, 5.4%), and no one contributed to three waves.

Generally, US undergraduates of all years/cohorts (mostly 1st-through-4th-year and predominantly first-year) contributed data in Spring 2019, Spring 2020, and Spring 2022. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Across all places that make up University Housing as well as across sentiments (i.e., “belong” and “don’t belong”), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (1,016, 98.5%), relatively few students contributed to two waves (15, 1.5%), and no one contributed to three waves. Additionally, students provided multiple responses for this particular analysis, because it combines responses regarding places that make up University Housing to form an overall representation of University Housing as a unified place: n = 619 students provided responses regarding one place, n = 136 provided responses regarding two places, and n = 14 provided responses regarding three places within University Housing.

Generally, degree-seeking international undergraduates (Freshman-through-Senior and predominantly Senior) contributed data in Spring 2020 and degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data in Spring 2022. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students could have contributed data more than once, but none did. Text was annotated using the tidytext package. The nrc lexicon (Mohammad &amp; Turney, 2013){target=“_blank”} was used to used to classify emotional content. Bar plot was generated using the ggplot2 package. Colors were produced using the rocket palette of the viridis package. 6.3.2.5 University Housing ## &lt;pointer: 0x0&gt; ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;magick-image&quot; Note: Emotions are presented in rank order from most to least prevalent. Percentage = the percentage of all eligible words classified as being representative of one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on Plutchik’s psychoevolutionary theory of emotion (Figure 1). Total number of text responses used in analysis of “belong” data was n = 40. There were no (or insufficient) “don’t belong” text responses for this place. The threshold for minimum number of responses was 20. Generally, degree-seeking international undergraduates (Freshman-through-Senior and predominantly Senior) contributed data in Spring 2020 and degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data in Spring 2022. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once, but none did. However, students did provide multiple responses for this particular analysis, because it combines responses regarding places that make up University Housing to form an overall representation of University Housing as a unified place: n = 27 students provided responses regarding one place, n = 2 provided responses regarding two places, and n = 3 provided responses regarding three places within University Housing. See Supplemental Method for more details. Text was annotated using the tidytext package. The nrc lexicon (Mohammad &amp; Turney, 2013){target=“_blank”} was used to used to classify emotional content. Bar plot was generated using the ggplot2 package.

Percentage = the percentage of all eligible words classified as being representative of one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on Plutchik’s psychoevolutionary theory of emotion (Figure 1). Total number of text responses used in analysis of “belong” data was n = 34. There were no (or insufficient) “don’t belong” text responses for this place. The threshold for minimum number of responses was 20. US and international graduates contributed data in Spring 2022. See Supplemental Method for more details. Text was annotated using the tidytext package. The nrc lexicon (Mohammad &amp; Turney, 2013){target=“_blank”} was used to used to classify emotional content.

Percentage = the percentage of all eligible words classified as being representative of one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on Plutchik’s psychoevolutionary theory of emotion (Figure 1). Inflated prevalence of positive emotions in “don’t belong” results are very likely due to negation (e.g., preceded by the word “not”). Total number of text responses used in analysis of “belong” data was n = 24. Total number of text responses used in analysis of “don’t belong” data was n = 23. US and international graduates contributed data in Spring 2022. See Supplemental Method for more details. Text was annotated using the tidytext package. The nrc lexicon (Mohammad &amp; Turney, 2013){target=“_blank”} was used to used to classify emotional content. Bar plots were generated using the ggplot2 package. Colors were produced using the rocket (Belong) and mako (Don’t Belong) palettes of the viridis package. "],["whom.html", "7 Where for Whom?", " 7 Where for Whom?
