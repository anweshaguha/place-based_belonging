<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank’s metrics are likely underestimated, and Lokey Science Complex appears as both an aggregated place and a subordinate place (Spring 2018) with legitimate subordinate places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 8,483; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 6,186. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 2,586; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 2,080. Again because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (<em>n</em> = 2,711, 86.4%), some students contributed to two waves (<em>n</em> = 295, 9.4%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (<em>n</em> = 131, 4.2%).

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “All Years” = Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “4th-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 402; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 301. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 142; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 110.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “3rd-Year” = 2019-20 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 596; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 461. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 211; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 175.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “2nd-Year” = 2020-21 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 522; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 434. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 196; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 168.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “1st-Year” = 2021-22 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2022, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 1,009; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 693. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 372; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 275.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “1st-through-5th-Year” = 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts (i.e., students who were at the end of their first, second, third, fourth, or fifth years at the UO in Spring 2018, respectively), meaning first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, or fifth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 2,866; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 1,758. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 995; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 709.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “4th-Year” = 2016-17 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 338; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 259. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 116; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 95.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “3rd-Year” = 2017-18 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 300; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 175. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 104; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 72.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “2nd-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 805; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 574. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 284; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 229.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “1st-Year” = 2019-20 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2020, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 1,400; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 727. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 483; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 304.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “1st-through-4th-Year” = 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts (i.e., students who were at the end of their first, second, third, or fourth years at the UO in Spring 2018, respectively), meaning first-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 1,814; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 1,439. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 631; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 560.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “4th-Year” = 2015-16 cohort, who were at the end of their fourth year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only fourth-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 237; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 207. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 81; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 76.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “3rd-Year” = 2016-17 cohort, who were at the end of their third year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only third-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 396; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 324. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 140; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 126.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “2nd-Year” = 2017-18 cohort, who were at the end of their second year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only second-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 307; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 253. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 107; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 97.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. “1st-Year” = 2018-19 cohort, who were at the end of their first year at the UO in Spring 2019, meaning that only first-year US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 874; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 655. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 303; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 261.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 1,202; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 1,035. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 432; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 399.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. However, because data are limited to Spring 2020 and Spring 2022 and methods were consistent between those waves, apart from a minor mislabeling of lawn regions, inaccuracy in representing places is due to physical changes in places, with the main changes being Unthank and Knight Campus construction. Spring 2022: Degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior degree-seeking international undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 383; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 223. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 138; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 91. No one contributed data to more than one wave. See <a href="supmeth.html#supmeth"><span style="color: #DF63A4">Supplemental Method</span></a> for more details.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. Degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 126; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 56. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 48; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 24.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior degree-seeking international undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 257; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 167. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 90; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 67.

<p>Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the “Show” dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click “Previous,” “Next,” or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the “Erb Memorial Union” entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the “EMU-Specific Places” entry contains EMU-level data. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by <em>n</em> Belong / (<em>n</em> Belong + <em>n</em> Don’t Belong) * 100. <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style="color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style="color: #11E8FF">Don’t Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the “belong” map or “don’t belong” map, respectively. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Click Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don’t belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total number of Belong or Don’t Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style="color: #11E8FF">Student Don’t Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don’t belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing <em>n</em> Belong and <em>n</em> Don’t Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those <em>n</em>s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, <em>n</em> Belong, <em>n</em> Don’t Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don’t Belong are all <span style="color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don’t Belong are <span style="color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. US and international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 305; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 193. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 129; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 82.

Additionally, all treemaps omit clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions. Some names of places with lower popularity were abbreviated to fit the text in their respective rectangles: <span style="color: #11E8FF">TF</span> = Turf Field, <span style="color: #11E8FF">DS</span> = Duck Store, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Barn</span> = Outdoor Program Barn, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Cas</span> = Cascade, <span style="color: #11E8FF">FAS</span> = Fine Art Studios, <span style="color: #11E8FF">MNL</span> = Many Nations Longhouse, <span style="color: #11E8FF">MS</span> = LERC Military Science, <span style="color: #11E8FF">MNCH</span> = Museum of Natural and Cultural History, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Moss</span> = Moss Street Children’s Center, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Fent</span> = Fenton, <span style="color: #11E8FF">LLC</span> = Living Learning Center, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Essl</span> = Esslinger, <span style="color: #11E8FF">BCC</span> = Black Cultural Center, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Mac</span> = McArthur Court, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Saun Stad</span> = Saunders Stadium, <span style="color: #11E8FF">Friend</span> = Friendly, <span style="color: #11E8FF">TI</span> = Tennis Indoor, span style = “color: #49C1AD”&gt;PLC</span> = Prince Lucien Campbell. Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness (treemaps within academic years are accurate, and because there are fewer available data, overall treemap for international students is accurate in this respect despite combining data). For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank’s popularity is likely underestimated and its inclusiveness may be, too, and Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2018) is depicted on the treemap along with places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 8,483; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 6,186. Total <em>n</em><sub>StudentBelong</sub> = 2,586; total <em>n</em><sub>StudentDon’tBelong</sub> = 2,080. Again because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (2,711, 86.4%), some students contributed to two waves (295, 9.4%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (131, 4.2%).

Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total <em>n</em><sub>ClickBelong</sub> = 4,016; total <em>n</em><sub>ClickDon’tBelong</sub> = 593.

See <a href="supmeth.html#supmeth"><span style="color: #DF63A4">Supplemental Method</span></a> for more details. Again because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (1,484, 89.2%), some students contributed to two waves (153, 9.2%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (27, 1.6%). Treemap was generated using the <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>treemapify</code> packages. Colors were produced using the <code>inferno</code> palette of the <code>viridis</code> package.</p>
